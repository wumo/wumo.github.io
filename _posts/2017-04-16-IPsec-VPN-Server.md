Windows Error 809
> The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established because the remote server is not responding.

to fix this error, a one-time registry change is required because the VPN server and/or client is behind NAT (e.g. home router). 
Refer to the linked web page, or run the following from an elevated command prompt. When finished, reboot your PC.
